This project samples use of convolutional neural networks to classify images of nature and infrastructure.
Four models with pre-trained hidden layers were used. Each model's final layer, used for classifying the images, 
was trained and validated on altered images. Alterations included cropping, translating, zooming, rotating, flipping, and contrasting.
The trained models were tested on an unseen, original set and then compared to one another on various error metrics.
